## Why does this exist?

* You want a Tailwind esque experience in pure vanilla CSS.
* Hate typing individual class and id selectors over.. and over..
* Wish to co-locate your `<style>` tags for ⚡️ [Locality of Behavior (LoB)](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/)
* Really wish `this` would work in `<style>` tags.
* Works with all new features including [CSS Nesting](https://caniuse.com/css-nesting)!
* No build step. Dependency-free. ~20 lines
* Pairs well with [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal) and [htmx](https://htmx.org)
* Want fewer layers, less complexity. Are aware of the cargo cult. ✈️

✨ Want to also inline scope your `<script>` tags? See our companion project, [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal)

## 👁️ How does it look?
```html
<div>
    <style>
        .this { background: red; } /* .self and .me also work! ✨ */
        .this button { background: blue; }
    </style>
    <button>I'm blue</button>
</div>
```

## 🌘 How does it work?

This uses `MutationObserver` to monitor the DOM, and the moment a `<style>` tag is seen, it scopes the styles to whatever the parent element is. No flashing or popping. 

This method also leaves your existing styles untouched, allowing you to mix and match at your liesure.

## 🤔 Why consider this over Tailwind CSS?

Use whatever you'd like, but there's a few advantages with this approach:

* No suffering from FOUC (a flash of unstyled content) as experienced in Tailwind CDN, Twind, UnoCSS.
* No high risk of eventually requiring a build step. It just works.
* No [deprecations](https://windicss.org/posts/sunsetting.html).
* Universal vanilla CSS. No special syntax or plugins to install.
